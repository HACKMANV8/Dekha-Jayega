  "world_lore": {
    "world_name": "Aethelburg",
    "geography": "Aethelburg is built on the confluence of the Thames and the River Fleet, now largely subterranean and channeling Aetheric energy. The city is divided into distinct districts: the opulent estates of Mayfair, the sprawling factories of Whitechapel, the academic institutions of Bloomsbury, and the shadowy docks of Rotherhithe. Notable landmarks include the Aetherium Refinery Tower, a colossal structure that dominates the skyline, and the Crystal Palace, rebuilt as a hub for Aetheric innovation. The abandoned, flooded sections beneath the city, known as the Sunken Ward, hide forgotten secrets and dangers.",
    "social_structures": "Aethelburg is rigidly stratified, with the Aetherium Barons at the top, followed by the middle class of merchants and professionals, and the working class toiling in the factories. The ARA acts as a powerful regulatory body, enforcing Aetheric laws and maintaining order, often through oppressive means. Secret societies, such as the 'Order of the Gear,' exert influence from behind the scenes."
