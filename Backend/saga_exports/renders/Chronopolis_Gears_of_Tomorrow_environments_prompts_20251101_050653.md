### Original Description

London, divided into boroughs each exhibiting unique temporal anomalies: Westminster (heart of the Great Clock, relatively stable), Whitechapel (frequent temporal echoes, objects and people momentarily repeating actions), Shoreditch (time slips, brief jumps to different eras), Rotherhithe (slow time, everything moves sluggishly), and the Isle of Dogs (fast time, accelerated growth and decay). The Thames occasionally reverses its flow due to temporal disturbances. Hidden beneath the city are the Clockwork Catacombs, remnants of failed temporal experiments.
