### Original Description

Aethelburg is built on the confluence of the Thames and the River Fleet, now largely subterranean and channeling Aetheric energy. The city is divided into distinct districts: the opulent estates of Mayfair, the sprawling factories of Whitechapel, the academic institutions of Bloomsbury, and the shadowy docks of Rotherhithe. Notable landmarks include the Aetherium Refinery Tower, a colossal structure that dominates the skyline, and the Crystal Palace, rebuilt as a hub for Aetheric innovation. The abandoned, flooded sections beneath the city, known as the Sunken Ward, hide forgotten secrets and dangers.
